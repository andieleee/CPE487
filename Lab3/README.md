# Lab 3: Bouncing Ball

> We pledge our honor that we have abided by the Stevens Honor System - Andrew Lee and Kavin Mohan

The main point of this lab was to make a ball move around a 600x800 serial monitor.  We were given five files, but only had to change ball.vhd. We had to change the size and color of the ball.
