# Material Descriptions
## Keypad
The Digilent Keypad is a 4x4 keypad that accepts input through buttons and sends it through the JB pin.  We only use the first three rows in order to give us one full octave.  Key 1 would represent C, Key 2 would represent C#, Key 3 would represent D, key A would represent E, and so on. As one moves down a row, the pitch increases over time. 
## Speaker
The speaker is plugged in through port JA.  The speaker should take the notes from the keypad and convert it to a 32 bit tone with the DAC.
